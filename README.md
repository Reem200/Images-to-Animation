# Images to Animation
This program reads from a text file (new.txt) using threads. 
The delays and the times the reading process is repeated make it to be viewed as an animation. 

Example from the first animation:
![Viewers windows](images-from-program/viewers-1.png)

Here is another one:
![Second viewd windows](images-from-program/viewers-2.png)
